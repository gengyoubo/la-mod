你跳进了末地传送门后它的出口不是你所熟悉的世界，是一个是一个陌生的世界。
(After you jumped into the Endgame portal its exit was not the world you knew, it was a strange world)

这里都是废弃的大楼，都长满苔藓了。
(It's all abandoned buildings. It's all covered in moss)

走着走着你发现有一只白色的胶兽和黑色的胶兽，但是和你遇到的不一样。
(Walking around you notice a white latex and a black latex, but not the same ones you encountered)

§3他是谁？我为什么从来都没见过？
§3(Who is he? Why have I never seen him before?)

§4看他的样子,看起来叫做PLAYERNAME？我在实验室里看到过一次他的名单
§4(By the looks of him, it looks like it's called PLAYERNAME. I saw his list in the lab once)

§3可是从我出生开始从来都没有看到过他呀？
§3(But I've never seen him since I was born?)

§4有两种可能，有一种就是他比我们早就出来了。另外一种......
§4(There are two possibilities, one is that he got out long before we did. The other ......)

§3另外一种是什么？
§3(What's the other one?)

§4他是从别的世界来的
§4(He's from another world)

他们的讨论让你很不爽，于是你说......
(Their discussion annoys you, so you say ......)

§5你们能不能尊重我一下？
§5(Will you guys show me some respect?)

......

为了打破这个尴尬的气氛，于是白色的胶兽开始开口说
(To break the awkwardness, so the white latex began to speak)

§4你好，叫我lin就可以了，他叫做puro。额，你叫什么名字？
§4(Hello, just call me Lin. He's called Puro. Uh, what's your name?)

§5......PLAYERNAME,你不是知道我的名字吗？
§5(......PLAYERNAME,Don't you know my name?)

......

气氛再一次尴尬了起来，这次是叫做puro的黑色的胶兽
(The atmosphere was once again awkward, this time it was the black latex called puro)

§3要不要吃个橘子？虽然很酸，但是很好吃！
§3(Want an orange? It's sour, but it's delicious!)

......

§3你是从别的世界来的？
§3(Are you from another world?)

§5是的，不仅是这样。而且......
§5(Yes, not only that. And ......)

......

你们聊了很久，但是你必须要回去了。
(You've been talking for a long time, but you have to get back)

§5我必须要回去了，家人们还在等着我！
§5(I have to get back. My family is waiting for me!)

§3那么，再见!下次再过来玩！
§3(So, bye! Come over and play next time!)

他们的旅途可能已经结束了，但是你的旅途现在才刚开始！
(Their journey may be over, but yours is just beginning now!)
